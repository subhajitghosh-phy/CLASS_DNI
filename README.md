This code is built on existing CLASS: Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System (https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public) code developed by Julien Lesgourgues and Thomas Tram. This code computes CMB power spectrum and matter power spectrum for Dark Neutrino interaction (DNI) cosmology in a *flat* universe.

In DNI cosmology the Standard model neutrinos interact with a fraction of total dark matter of the universe (NIDM - Neutrino interacting DM) with temperature independent scattering cross-section. This cosmology predicts a higher value of Hubble constant owing to the modification of neutrino induced phase shift in the CMB (https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09843). It also predicts enhancement of primordial gravitational waves and CMB B modes (https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09929)
